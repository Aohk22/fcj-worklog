Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience.

They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

The monolithic analysis script was broken down into logical modules, separating concerns such as file hash validation, PE analysis, ELF analysis, and decompilation functionality. This modular approach makes the code easier to test, debug, and extend with new features.\nRefactoring Core Analysis Functions Significantly refactored the core analysis functions to improve code quality and performance:\nHash Detection System: Improved the malware hash detection system by implementing lazy loading for the malware hash database. The _loadMalwareHashes() function now efficiently loads and caches hash values from the database file, with proper error handling for missing files. The _checkMalwareBySha256() function provides fast O(1) lookup using a set data structure.\nFile Type Detection: Enhanced file type detection using TrID (TrIDent) library integration. The _getFileTypeTrid() function now provides detailed file type identification with confidence percentages, helping to identify potentially malicious files that may be masquerading as legitimate file types.\nString Extraction: Implemented efficient string extraction from binary files using the _getStrings() helper function, which leverages the Linux strings utility to extract human-readable strings that can provide insights into malware behavior and capabilities.\nPE (Portable Executable) Analysis Enhancements Developed comprehensive helper functions for analyzing Windows PE files:\nSection Analysis: Created _getPESections() function that extracts detailed information about PE file sections including virtual addresses, sizes, MD5 hashes, and entropy values. The entropy calculation helps identify packed or encrypted sections that are common in malware, flagging sections with entropy above 7 or below 3 as suspicious.\nArchitecture Detection: Implemented _getPEMetaArch() to identify whether a PE file is 32-bit or 64-bit based on the machine type value in the PE header.\nTimestamp Validation: Developed _getPEMetaTimestamp() function that not only converts PE timestamps to human-readable format but also performs sanity checks to detect suspicious timestamps (dates before 2000 or future dates), which are common indicators of tampered or malicious executables.\nELF (Executable and Linkable Format) Analysis Tools Implemented robust helper functions for analyzing Linux ELF binaries:\nHeader Parsing: Created _getELFHeader() function that uses the readelf utility to extract critical ELF header information including magic numbers, class (32/64-bit), data encoding, file type, and target machine architecture.\nSymbol Table Analysis: Developed _getELFSymEntries() function that parses the symbol table to extract function names, types, and visibility information. This helps identify imported libraries and exported functions that may reveal malware functionality.\nSegment Information: Implemented _getELFSegments() placeholder function for extracting program segment information, which will be further developed to analyze memory layout and permissions.\nDecompilation Integration Integrated Ghidra headless decompilation capabilities through the _getDecompilation() function:\nImplemented secure temporary file handling for decompilation input/output Configured Ghidra headless analyzer with custom script paths Added proper environment variable setup for Java runtime Implemented error handling and validation for decompilation results The function now generates readable pseudocode from binary executables, enabling deeper analysis of malware behavior Code Quality Improvements Throughout the week, focused on improving overall code quality:\nAdded consistent error handling with try-except blocks Implemented proper resource cleanup using context managers Added informative logging and debug output Improved function documentation and type hints Optimized subprocess calls for better performance Standardized naming conventions across all helper functions Next Steps Implement unit tests for all helper functions Integrate helper functions into the main API endpoints Continue development of dynamic analysis capabilities "},{"uri":"https://Aohk22.github.io/workshop-report/1-worklog/1.7-week7/","title":"Week 7 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 7 Objectives Restructure Terraform codebase for better maintainability Implement modular architecture following Terraform best practices Learn and integrate AWS Image Builder for automated AMI creation Tasks and Achievements Task Start Date Completion Date Reference Material Research Terraform best practices.Plan new folder structure for modules and environments. 17-10-2025 17-10-2025 https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/moduleshttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/modules/module Restructure Terraform codebase:- Create module structure with main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf- Extract VPC, Subnet, Launch Template, Instance Profile modules- Extract Service Auto Scale and Image Builder modules 18-10-2025 20-10-2025 https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develophttps://www.terraform-best-practices.com/ Implement environment-specific configurations:- Create dev environment directory- Implement modules in environment context- Create .tfvars files for variable management 20-10-2025 21-10-2025 Comments Terraform Code Restructuring As the project grew in complexity, the original Terraform structure with all resources defined in flat files became increasingly difficult to maintain. The old structure consisted of multiple .tf files in a single directory, making it challenging to understand dependencies, reuse code, and manage different environments.\nImplementing Terraform Module Standard Restructured the entire Terraform codebase following industry best practices and the standard module structure. Each reusable component was extracted into its own module with the standard three-file pattern:\nmain.tf - Contains the primary resource definitions variables.tf - Defines input variables with descriptions and types outputs.tf - Exports values for use by other modules This modular approach significantly improves code reusability, testing capabilities, and overall maintainability. Modules can now be versioned independently and reused across different environments.\nNew Folder Structure Design Designed and implemented a hierarchical folder structure separating concerns:\nModules Directory: Contains six reusable infrastructure modules:\nVPC Module - Virtual Private Cloud configuration with CIDR blocks and networking settings Subnet Module - Subnet creation with availability zone distribution Launch Template Module - EC2 launch configuration with user data and instance settings Instance Profile Module - IAM roles and instance profiles for EC2 permissions Service Auto Scale Module - Auto Scaling Groups and Target Groups for elasticity Image Builder Module - AWS Image Builder pipeline configuration for automated AMI creation Environments Directory: Contains environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production). Each environment implements the modules defined above with environment-specific variables through .tfvars files.

The infrastructure required AMIs to be built by the Image Builder pipeline before the launch templates and auto-scaling groups could be created. However, the standard terraform apply command attempted to create all resources simultaneously, causing failures due to missing AMI references.\nTargeted Resource Initialization Implemented a strategic deployment approach using Terraform\u0026rsquo;s -target option to control resource creation order. This technique allows for granular control over which resources are created first, ensuring dependencies are satisfied before dependent resources are provisioned.\nImage Builder Pre-Initialization Strategy: Created a phased deployment process:\nPhase 1 - Image Builder Infrastructure: Used terraform apply -target=module.image_builder to initialize only the Image Builder pipeline components including:\nIAM roles and instance profiles Image Builder components (build scripts) Image recipes and distributions Pipeline configuration and schedules Phase 2 - AMI Generation: Triggered the Image Builder pipeline either manually or waited for scheduled execution to generate the required AMIs. This step ensures that valid AMI IDs are available in the AWS account before proceeding.\nPhase 3 - Full Infrastructure: Once AMIs were built and available, executed terraform apply without targets to provision the remaining infrastructure:\nVPC and networking components Security groups and routing tables Launch templates referencing the newly created AMIs Auto-scaling groups and load balancers DynamoDB tables and other services This phased approach solved the circular dependency problem where launch templates needed AMI IDs that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist until Image Builder completed its first run.\nAlternative Approaches Evaluated Explored several alternative solutions before settling on the targeted initialization approach:\nData Source Lookups: Considered using Terraform data sources to look up existing AMIs, but this required manual AMI creation for the first deployment Null Resources with Provisioners: Evaluated using null resources to trigger Image Builder and wait for completion, but found this approach less reliable Separate Terraform Workspaces: Considered splitting infrastructure into two separate Terraform projects, but this increased complexity and reduced maintainability AMI ID Variables: Attempted to use variables for AMI IDs, but this still required manual intervention for initial deployment The -target option provided the best balance of simplicity, reliability, and automation.\n"},{"uri":"https://Aohk22.github.io/workshop-report/1-worklog/1.9-week9/","title":"Week 9 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 9 Objectives Rewrite frontend application using Bun runtime Improve user interface for malware analysis reports Implement automated report parsing utilities Tasks and Achievements Task Start Date Completion Date Reference Material Migrate frontend to Bun runtime:- Restructure project dependencies- Update build scripts and configuration- Test compatibility with existing APIs 31-10-2025 01-11-2025 https://bun.sh/https://bun.sh/docs Implement UI enhancements:- Add scrolling for decompiled code section- Add scrolling for extracted strings section- Improve report layout and readability 02-11-2025 03-11-2025 Develop automated report parsing utilities:- Create objectWalk() function for recursive traversal- Implement headerize() for camelCase to Title Case conversion- Organize utilities in util.js module 03-11-2025 05-11-2025 https://github.com/Aohk22/fcj-1-file-analyzer/blob/main/srvc_web/app/util.js Comments Frontend Migration to Bun Completed a full rewrite of the frontend application using Bun, a modern JavaScript runtime that offers significant performance improvements over traditional Node.js. Bun provides:\nFaster startup times and reduced memory footprint Built-in bundler, transpiler, and package manager Native TypeScript support without additional configuration Improved developer experience with faster hot reload The migration involved restructuring the project dependencies, updating build scripts, and ensuring compatibility with existing API integrations. The new Bun-based frontend demonstrates noticeably faster load times and improved responsiveness.\nUser Interface Enhancements Implemented critical UI improvements to enhance the user experience when viewing malware analysis reports:\nScrolling for Decompiled Code: Added scrollable containers for the decompiled code section. Since Ghidra decompilation can generate thousands of lines of pseudocode, displaying everything at once was impractical and caused browser performance issues. The new scrollable view:\nLimits initial viewport to a manageable height Maintains code formatting and syntax Provides smooth scrolling for large codebases Improves page load performance by virtualizing content rendering Scrolling for Extracted Strings: Similarly implemented scrollable containers for the strings section. Binary files often contain thousands of extracted strings, making them difficult to navigate. The scrollable strings view:\nOrganizes strings in a clean, readable format Allows users to quickly scan through large string collections Maintains search functionality within the scrollable area Improves overall report readability Automated Report Parsing Solution Addressed a significant development pain point: manually parsing large, nested report objects from the analysis API was becoming increasingly tedious and error-prone. As the analysis capabilities expanded, the report structure grew more complex with deeply nested objects containing PE sections, ELF headers, symbol tables, and various metadata.\n"},{"uri":"https://Aohk22.github.io/workshop-report/1-worklog/","title":"Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Worklog.

Executive Summary The IoT Weather Platform is designed for the ITea Lab team in Ho Chi Minh City to enhance weather data collection and analysis. It supports up to 5 weather stations, with potential scalability to 10-15, utilizing Raspberry Pi edge devices with ESP32 sensors to transmit data via MQTT. The platform leverages AWS Serverless services to deliver real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and cost efficiency, with access restricted to 5 lab members via Amazon Cognito.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current weather stations require manual data collection, becoming unmanageable with multiple units. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are costly and overly complex.\nThe Solution The platform uses AWS IoT Core to ingest MQTT data, AWS Lambda and API Gateway for processing, Amazon S3 for storage (including a data lake), and AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load data from the S3 data lake to another S3 bucket for analysis. AWS Amplify with Next.js provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to Thingsboard and CoreIoT, users can register new devices and manage connections, though this platform operates on a smaller scale and is designed for private use. Key features include real-time dashboards, trend analysis, and low operational costs.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The solution establishes a foundational resource for lab members to develop a larger IoT platform, serving as a study resource, and provides a data foundation for AI enthusiasts for model training or analysis. It reduces manual reporting for each station via a centralized platform, simplifying management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. Monthly costs are $0.66 USD per the AWS Pricing Calculator, with a 12-month total of $7.92 USD. All IoT equipment costs are covered by the existing weather station setup, eliminating additional development expenses. The break-even period of 6-12 months is achieved through significant time savings from reduced manual work.\n3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a serverless AWS architecture to manage data from 5 Raspberry Pi-based stations, scalable to 15. Data is ingested via AWS IoT Core, stored in an S3 data lake, and processed by AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to transform and load it into another S3 bucket for analysis. Lambda and API Gateway handle additional processing, while Amplify with Next.js hosts the dashboard, secured by Cognito. The architecture is detailed below:\nAWS Services Used AWS IoT Core: Ingests MQTT data from 5 stations, scalable to 15. AWS Lambda: Processes data and triggers Glue jobs (two functions). Amazon API Gateway: Facilitates web app communication. Amazon S3: Stores raw data in a data lake and processed outputs (two buckets). AWS Glue: Crawlers catalog data, and ETL jobs transform and load it. AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js web interface. Amazon Cognito: Secures access for lab users. Component Design Edge Devices: Raspberry Pi collects and filters sensor data, sending it to IoT Core. Data Ingestion: AWS IoT Core receives MQTT messages from the edge devices. Data Storage: Raw data is stored in an S3 data lake; processed data is stored in another S3 bucket. Data Processing: AWS Glue Crawlers catalog the data, and ETL jobs transform it for analysis. Web Interface: AWS Amplify hosts a Next.js app for real-time dashboards and analytics. User Management: Amazon Cognito manages user access, allowing up to 5 active accounts. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases This project has two parts—setting up weather edge stations and building the weather platform—each following 4 phases:\nBuild Theory and Draw Architecture: Research Raspberry Pi setup with ESP32 sensors and design the AWS serverless architecture (1 month pre-internship) Calculate Price and Check Practicality: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and adjust if needed (Month 1). Fix Architecture for Cost or Solution Fit: Tweak the design (e.g., optimize Lambda with Next.js) to stay cost-effective and usable (Month 2). Develop, Test, and Deploy: Code the Raspberry Pi setup, AWS services with CDK/SDK, and Next.js app, then test and release to production (Months 2-3). Technical Requirements\nWeather Edge Station: Sensors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed), a microcontroller (ESP32), and a Raspberry Pi as the edge device. Raspberry Pi runs Raspbian, handles Docker for filtering, and sends 1 MB/day per station via MQTT over Wi-Fi. Weather Platform: Practical knowledge of AWS Amplify (hosting Next.js), Lambda (minimal use due to Next.js), AWS Glue (ETL), S3 (two buckets), IoT Core (gateway and rules), and Cognito (5 users). Use AWS CDK/SDK to code interactions (e.g., IoT Core rules to S3). Next.js reduces Lambda workload for the fullstack web app. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline\nPre-Internship (Month 0): 1 month for planning and old station review. Internship (Months 1-3): 3 months. Month 1: Study AWS and upgrade hardware. Month 2: Design and adjust architecture. Month 3: Implement, test, and launch. Post-Launch: Up to 1 year for research. 6. Budget Estimation You can find the budget estimation on the AWS Pricing Calculator.\nOr you can download the Budget Estimation File.\nInfrastructure Costs AWS Services: AWS Lambda: $0.00/month (1,000 requests, 512 MB storage). S3 Standard: $0.15/month (6 GB, 2,100 requests, 1 GB scanned). Data Transfer: $0.02/month (1 GB inbound, 1 GB outbound). AWS Amplify: $0.35/month (256 MB, 500 ms requests). Amazon API Gateway: $0.01/month (2,000 requests). AWS Glue ETL Jobs: $0.02/month (2 DPUs). AWS Glue Crawlers: $0.07/month (1 crawler). MQTT (IoT Core): $0.08/month (5 devices, 45,000 messages). Total: $0.7/month, $8.40/12 months\nHardware: $265 one-time (Raspberry Pi 5 and sensors). 7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Network Outages: Medium impact, medium probability. Sensor Failures: High impact, low probability. Cost Overruns: Medium impact, low probability. Mitigation Strategies Network: Local storage on Raspberry Pi with Docker. Sensors: Regular checks and spares. Cost: AWS budget alerts and optimization. Contingency Plans Revert to manual methods if AWS fails. Use CloudFormation for cost-related rollbacks. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements: Real-time data and analytics replace manual processes.\nScalable to 10-15 stations.\nLong-term Value 1-year data foundation for AI research.\nReusable for future projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://Aohk22.github.io/workshop-report/5-workshop/5.3-s3-vpc/5.3.2-test-gwe/","title":"Test the Gateway Endpoint","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Create S3 bucket Navigate to S3 management console In the Bucket console, choose Create bucket In the Create bucket console Name the bucket: choose a name that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been given to any bucket globally (hint: lab number and your name) Leave other fields as they are (default) Scroll down and choose Create bucket Successfully create S3 bucket. Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nHere, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nOverall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future?
